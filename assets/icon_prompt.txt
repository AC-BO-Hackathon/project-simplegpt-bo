Design a circular logo for SimpleGPT-BO, an innovative tool that marries ChatGPT’s advanced capabilities with the precision of Bayesian Optimization for users at all skill levels. 
The logo should reflect a synthesis of simplicity and advanced technology, embodying the concept of making sophisticated tech accessible to everyone. 
Draw inspiration from Japanese futuristic anime, known for its clean lines, dynamic designs, and a blend of traditional and cutting-edge themes.
Incorporate elements that suggest a scientific or mathematical graph, symbolizing the tool’s optimization capabilities.
Use a soft palette of blues and greys to convey a sense of calm intelligence and positivity.
Ensure the design is straightforward yet engaging, appealing to both novices and tech enthusiasts who seek to explore Bayesian Optimization through the MyGPT platform on ChatGPT.
The overall vibe should be welcoming, innovative, and imbued with a sense of future possibilities, aligning with the ethos of democratizing advanced technological tools.
