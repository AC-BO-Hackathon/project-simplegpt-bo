# SimpleGPT-BO

SimpleGPT-BO is an intuitive tool designed to democratize the power of ChatGPT-driven Bayesian Optimization, making it accessible and straightforward for both beginners and experienced users alike. By leveraging the MyGPT platform provided by ChatGPT, SimpleGPT-BO offers generated instructions and codes, allowing users to experience Bayesian Optimization (BO) under ChatGPT with minimal hassle.

## Features

- **Guided Bayesian Optimization**: Step-by-step guidance to perform Bayesian optimizations with the support of a Language Learning Model (LLM).
- **Multiple Acquisition Functions**: Includes four acquisition functions (PI, EI, UCB, TPE) to cater to different optimization needs.
- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Supports multi-objective optimizations through the weighted single objective transformation for comprehensive analysis and results.

## Advantages

- **No Installation Required**: Use directly within ChatGPT without the need for any installations, making it accessible from any language environment.
- **Low Effort**: All instructions and codes are generated, significantly reducing the effort required for implementations.
- **Accessibility**: Can be used from anywhere, providing a seamless experience for users worldwide.
- **Innovative Integration**: Takes advantage of ChatGPT's capabilities for an enhanced Bayesian optimization process.

## Usage

1. **Via ChatGPT**: Login to ChatGPT and search for SimpleGPT-BO from the Explore GPTs section.
2. **Direct Access**: You can also access SimpleGPT-BO directly through [SimpleGPT-BO's URL](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-3pVerd4XF-simplegpt-bo).

## Limitations

- **Simple Optimizations**: Primarily designed for simple optimization tasks using basic acquisition functions.
- Additional limitations include a potential lack of depth in complex scenario analysis and a reliance on the quality of the generated instructions.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community to make SimpleGPT-BO even better. Here are a few areas where you can help:
